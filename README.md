# Nier: Automata fishing bot

For installation instructions, see INSTALL.md.

To use:

1. Open Nier: Automata and navigate to a body of water you want to fish in. If possible, stand in the water.
2. Disable music and voice volume in your settings for the game
3. Kill any other open applications that might make sounds.
4. Begin fishing by holding down the E key.
4. Alt tab to your command prompt and run `python nierfishingbot.py`
5. Sit back and let it fish until it's caught the fish you want.
6. Alt tab back to the command prompt and press ctrl-c to kill the bot.

# Troubleshooting

You might need to adjust the constants in the script file depending on the location of the body of water relative to where you're standing, the amount of ambient sound in the environment you're in, and how long you're willing to wait before recasting the line. If the script is working correctly, it should be regularly catching fish. I wrote this for my personal use since I wanted to complete the fishing log but the game's RNG is ridiculous, so your mileage may vary.
